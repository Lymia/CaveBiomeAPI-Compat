# CaveBiomeAPI (Embeddium Compat)

You can find the original project here: [CaveBiomeAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cavebiomeapi)

This is a fix for [embeddedt/embeddium#172](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/issues/172) and
[ItsBlackGear/CaveBiomeAPI#30](https://github.com/ItsBlackGear/CaveBiomeAPI/issues/30) that avoids the problem where
biome colors don't work at all. As CaveBiomeAPI seems completely unmaintained for 3 years, it seems easier to fix it
externally rather than wait for a patch.
