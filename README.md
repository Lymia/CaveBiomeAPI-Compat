# SimpleCaveBiomes

A drop-in replacement for CaveBiomeAPI with better mod compatibility. Only Forge is currently supported.

You can find the original project here: [CaveBiomeAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cavebiomeapi)

## Installation

* Remove CaveBiomeAPI from your mods directory.
* Install SimpleCaveBiomes in its place.

## Limitations

Unlike CaveBiomeAPI, SimpleCaveBiomes does not implement carvers to attempt to replicate 1.18 world generation. Use
[YUNG's Better Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-caves) instead.
