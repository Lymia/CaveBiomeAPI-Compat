# SimpleCaveBiomes

A drop-in replacement for CaveBiomeAPI with better mod compatibility.

Only Forge is currently supported. There are no significant mods that use the Fabric version to my knowledge. Please
submit an issue if you know of a mod worth porting it to Fabric for.

You can find the original project here: [CaveBiomeAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cavebiomeapi)

## Installation

* Remove CaveBiomeAPI from your mods directory.
* Install SimpleCaveBiomes in its place.

## Limitations

Unlike CaveBiomeAPI, SimpleCaveBiomes does not implement carvers to attempt to replicate 1.18 cave caverns. Use
[YUNG's Better Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-caves) instead.
